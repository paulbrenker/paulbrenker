# Welcome!

I'm a Computer Science graduate from Bonn, Germany, where I studied at the [H-BRS](https://www.h-brs.de/de).

Over the past year, I gained valuable experience as a working student in software engineering at [SAP LeanIX](https://www.leanix.net/de/), honing my skills in collaborative software development.

I'm passionate about building software that delivers real value to customers and I thrive on teamwork and innovation.
